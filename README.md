## General Information and Useful Tips

+ C is a powerful and versatile programming language widely used in systems programming, embedded systems, and low-level development.
+ Memory management is crucial in C. Always be mindful of allocating and deallocating memory appropriately to avoid memory leaks.
+ Pay attention to pointer arithmetic to avoid segmentation faults and undefined behavior.
+ Use meaningful variable and function names to improve code readability.
+ Comment your code to explain complex logic and make it easier for others (and your future self) to understand.

## Requirements

To work with this project, you must have the following tools installed:
+ [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) : GNU Compiler Collection
+ [Betty](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty) :  C code checker

## Navigation Guide

To access any project you wish to view, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pericles001/alx-low_level_programming
   cd alx-low_level_programming
   ```
   
2. Open your desired project (e.g., "0x01-variables_if_else_while"):

   ``` bash
   cd 0x01-variables_if_else_while
   ```
   
3. Compile and run your desired file (e.g., "2-print_alphabet.c"):

   ``` bash
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 2-print_alphabet.c -2-print_alphabet
   ./2-print_alphabet
   ```
